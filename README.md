## Routing
  Routing is implemented in react old version using Router and Switch, but now its replaced with Routes and inner child consist of Route with path for Example

**Note: we want to connect your app to the browser's URL: import BrowserRouter and render it around your whole app.

### ` <BrowserRouter> <App /> </BrowserRouter>`
### `<Link to="/"> home</Link>`

### `<Routes> <Route path="/" element={<HomeContainer />} /> <Routes>`
